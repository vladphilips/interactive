	<h1>About this Zine</h1>
	</div>
	
	<div class="maintext">
	Because of pervasive corruption, illegal street racing culture is particularly strong in Russia. Racers can simply bribe the police and get away with almost anything. Since they don’t have to cover their faces, street racers boast about speeding and otherwise breaking the law on YouTube getting millions of views and followers.<br>
	<br>

	My American friends are usually shocked by this content, so I dedicated a zine to Russian street racing, which I am following on YouTube for more than ten years now.
	The name of the zine is inspired by a quote by Eric Davidich, a famous Russian car blogger: <b>‘These guys are in a hurry to God’s reception.’</b> He was referring to a group of St. Petersburg street racers.<br>
